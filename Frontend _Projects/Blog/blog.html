	<p class="p1">No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.</p>

	<p>I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive? </p>

	<p>Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? 
	A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks! </p>

	<p class="p1">I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict.</p>

	<p>Has your condition worsened? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? No, clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? Where is Pinkman now.</p>

	<p>I handle the business operations. With all due respect, Don Eladio. I didn't sell it to them. I gave them samples. I gave them samples to give to you. To introduce you to our product. This product is the drug of the future. It'll triple your profits. Perhaps quadruple. </p>
